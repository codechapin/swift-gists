A repo for small Swift code for learning the language and libraries.

In here we will avoid using XCode and the Swift Package Manager (SPM),
done this way for learning the available CLI tools in Swift.

Things I learned: Array, Data and UnsafePointers allocate in the heap. InlineArray
could be useful to help with memory intensive applications.
